A ski resort company is planning to construct a new ski slope using a pre-existing network of mountain huts and trails between them. A new slope has to begin at one of the mountain huts, have a middle station at another hut connected with the first one by a direct trail, and end at the third mountain hut which is also connected by a direct trail to the second hut. The altitude of the three huts chosen for constructing the ski slope has to be strictly decreasing.
You are given two SQL tables, mountain_huts and trails, with the following structure:
create table mountain_huts (
id integer not null,
name varchar(40) not null,
altitude integer not null,
unique(name),
unique(id)
);
create table trails (
hut1 integer not null,
hut2 integer not null
);
insert into mountain_huts values (1, 'Dakonat', 1900);
insert into mountain_huts values (2, 'Natisa', 2100);
insert into mountain_huts values (3, 'Gajantut', 1600);
insert into mountain_huts values (4, 'Rifat', 782);
insert into mountain_huts values (5, 'Tupur', 1370);
insert into trails values (1, 3);
insert into trails values (3, 2);
insert into trails values (3, 5);
insert into trails values (4, 5);
insert into trails values (1, 5);
Each entry in the table trails represents a direct connection between huts with IDs hut1 and hut2. Note that all trails are bidirectional.
Create a query that finds all triplets(startpt,middlept,endpt) representing the mountain huts that may be used for construction of a ski slope.
Output returned by the query can be ordered in any way.
Examples:
1.Given the tables:
mountain_huts:
Id
Name
Altitude
1
Dakonat
1900
2
Natisa
2100
3
Gajantut
1600
4
Rifat
782
5
Tupur
1370
trails:
Hut1
Hut2
1
3
3
2
3
5
4
5
1
5
Your query should return:
startpt
middlept
endpt
Dakonat
Gajantut
Tupur
Dakonat
Tupur
Rifat
Gajantut
Tupur
Rifat
Natisa
Gajantut
Tupur
Assume that:

 there is no trail going from a hut back to itself;

 for every two huts there is at most one direct trail connecting them;

 each hut from table trails occurs in table mountain_huts;
